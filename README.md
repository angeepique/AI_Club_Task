This project aims to predict employees' salaries in Chicago using an artificial neural network (ANN).The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, age, years of experience, salary, and other relevant features. The dataset also includes the employees' salaries.
The project first preprocesses the data by cleaning, normalizing, and encoding categorical variables. Feature selection is performed to choose the most relevant features that can affect employee salaries. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.
An ANN is built with multiple hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each layer is determined through experimentation. The ANN is trained using the training set, and its performance is evaluated using the testing set. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The results show that the ANN is able to predict employees' salaries with a high degree of accuracy.
Overall, this project provides a useful approach to predicting employee salaries using an ANN, which can be applied in various industries to inform salary negotiations and HR policies.
MSE (Mean Squared Error) is a commonly used evaluation metric in salary prediction models. It measures the average squared difference between the actual salary values and the predicted salary values.
MSE can be used to compare the performance of different salary prediction models. For example, if two models are developed to predict salaries, the model with the lower MSE value is considered to be more accurate.
Overall, MSE is a useful evaluation metric in salary prediction models, as it provides a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy and can be used to compare different models.
